(maybe load random values into register?)
(push all registers and sreg and pc (later add offset))
(run target instruction)
(push sreg, all registers and pc (later substract offset)
(pop stack and send using uart)
;; client can then analyze the data
;; do this multiple times using fuzzing

;; Another idea would be to flash one instruction using the serial cable so you don't need to reflash the whole thing again and again.
